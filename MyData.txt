A class is usually modeled after a Noun. Classes are things.
So we might make a class that represents a Person, House, Vehicle,
or Animal. These are all common examples to use when learning about classes.
For us, we will create a Vehicle class. What information would we associate with a
vehicle, and what behavior would it have? A vehicle may have a type, brand, model and
so on. This type of information is stored in variables called attributes. These things also
have behaviors. A Vehicle can drive, stop, honk its horn, and so on. Behaviors are
contained in functions and a function that is part of a class is called a method.
